# cooper.jar

`cooper.jar` is a small library that can be optionally used in Elements projects for the Java and Android platform compiled with the [RemObjects Elements](http://elementscompiler.com) compiler. It provides some of the core runtime types that expand upon what's provided by the platform, as well as helper classes and functions.

`cooper.jar` ships precompiled with the [Elements](http://elementscompiler.com) compiler, and new projects created with one of the Java project templates will automatically have a reference to the library. Should you need to add a reference manually, you can do so via the [Add References](http://docs.elementscompiler.com/Projects/References) dialog in Fire or Visual Studio, where `cooper.jar` should show automatically.

`cooper.jar` used to be called `com.remobjects.elements.rtl.jar`.

The code for this library is open source and available under a liberal license. We appreciate contributions.
